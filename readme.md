# "whatBill?" - Shared Living Made Easy

Shared living-space management application, "whatBill?", allows you to track bills, personal IOUs, & household chores all while seamlessly staying in sync with your co-habitants.

"whatBill?" was built with shared-living in mind; a tool to aid communication, rather than replace it.

**Features:**

-Connect your bank using Plaid and automatically find your recurring expenses, and any potential IOUs.

-Share, split, and notify members of your home of any bills coming due

-Create and manage personal IOUs

-IOUs and Bills can use multi-factor authentication, requiring either a two party signature, or a verified bank transaction, to be marked as paid and completed.

-Easily pay your roommates for your portion of bills and any outstanding IOUs with Square integration. 

-Share and fairly assign household chores

-Push notifications so you're always up-to-date
