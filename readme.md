# "whatBill?" - Shared Living Made Easy

Revolutionizing the way shared living-spaces manage their expenses, "whatBill?" allows you to track bills, personal IOUs, household chores, and your pantry, all while seamlessly staying in sync with your co-habitants. The best part, an internet connection and login are not necessary!

"whatBill?" was built with shared-living in mind; a tool to aid communication, rather than replace it.

**Features:**

-Connect your bank using Plaid and automatically find your recurring expenses, and any potential IOUs.

-Share, split, and notify members of your home of any bills coming due

-Create and manage personal IOUs

-IOUs and Bills can use multi-factor authentication, requiring either a two party signature, or a verified bank transaction, to be marked as paid and completed.

-Share and fairly assign household chores

-Track your home’s fridge, pantry, and any other shared consumables

-Easily viewable list of what’s in the home, which items are whose, and expiration dates.

-Adding pantry items or completing a grocery trip is as easy as scanning the barcode before putting the item away

-Create a shopping list, and set reminders based on your environment, such as when you’re leaving work or even when you’re near a grocery store.
